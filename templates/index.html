  <p>Using various machine learning algorithms, our project takes several attributes from a student class performance dataset such as first semester grades, second semester grades, absences, study time, etc., and predicts what the student's final grade will be for that class. The algorithms that were employed in our project were linear regression, k-nearest neighbors, and random forest.</p>

  <p>To understand the functionality of this project, one must first understand what machine learning is and how it works. Simply put, machine learning is the process of introducing a dataset to a software model, training our model on that dataset to increase accuracy, and then using this trained model to solve problems with new, unseen data. In the realm of machine learning, linear regression is a basic algorithm that evaluates scattered data points and attempts to create a best-fit line based on those data points. This best-fit line establishes a relationship between the independent and dependent variables of the problem that this algorithm is being utilized to solve. Linear regression is best implemented to evaluate data points that have strong correlation. Using this method to evaluate data points that are lacking a strong correlation will make it difficult for this algorithm to correctly identify the relationship between the points. The standard function, y = mx + b, is used to implement this algorithm where the attributes or characteristics of the data points are the input values and along with the other parts of the function, allow this algorithm to output a value which in different contexts could be something like a predicted future value. Our next algorithm, k-nearest neighbors, is an algorithm that makes predictions based on the proximity of other data points. K-nearest neighbors takes the average of the values of the nearest neighbors determined by Euclidean distance and uses this to make a prediction on the value of the unknown data point. The random forest algorithm is one that outputs the decisions of multiple decision trees and uses these to come to a final decision, the average or mean of all the decision trees in the “forest”. Decision trees start with a question of some sort and based on the answer to this question, create different nodes of the tree. All of the algorithms used are examples of supervised learning, a machine learning method where our model is trained on input data that has been labeled for a particular output. The model is trained until it can detect the underlying patterns and relationships between the input data and the output labels, enabling it to yield accurate labeling results when presented with never-before-seen data.</p>

  <p>To be able to predict a user's final grade, we first needed to import a dataset that was sourced from two secondary education Portuguese schools under the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. For each algorithm, we began by reading in our file and then specifying what attributes we wanted to train our model on to create our data frame. After specifying which attribute was to be predicated as well, we then split these into two separate arrays for the attributes and predicted value respectively; these two arrays were then split into four arrays which are two training arrays and two testing arrays. 10% of the dataset was left out of the training set and used to test on. Since we know what the true value of that 10% is, we can compare the predictions to this data and assess the accuracy. From there, we could then make use of auxiliary python function libraries like scikit-learn  with the algorithms built into them and create our model for each respective algorithm. After creating our models, the training data arrays are then fit into these models. Once the data had been fit into the models, we could then use score functions to assess the accuracy by passing our testing arrays into these functions. To get a cohesive view of how our models performed in the tests, we used data visualization libraries to display the result as seen in the hyperlinks in the dropdowns below.

<div class="content">
  <p>Based on our analysis of the models' performance, as seen in notebooks accessible through the provided hyperlinks, the random forest algorithm performed the best in terms of prediction accuracy. Random Forest outperformed Linear Regression due to the fact that Linear Regression assumes their to be a linear relationship between the data points, so when there are data points that are outliers compared to other data points that display a strong correlation, this model cannot accurately establish the relationship between all data points. Similar to the faults of Linear Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors also produces accuracy issues when implemented with large data sets and large variation between the data since relationships are established based on the distance between data points. Random Forest proves to be a more accurate model because while single decision trees can be prone to bias and overfitting, a “forest” of decision trees can increase the accuracy as the randomness involved in the development of each tree allows for more diversity among the different predictions of each tree, allowing the final prediction of the “forest” to be more accurate compared to that of a single decision tree.
